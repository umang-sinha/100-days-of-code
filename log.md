### Day 8: March 9, 2021

**Today's Progress: Tried replicating Tom Scott's YouTube video where the title of the video updates dynamically according to the number of views. In my case the title updates to reflect the number of view, likes, dislikes and comments**

**Thoughts: Discovered something called Google Apps Script. Seems quite fun. Can think of some automation projects to do using this**
